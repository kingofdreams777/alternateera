                    Alternate Era is an idea. A collaboration of events in time
                    that coincided with the birth of the most groundbreaking,
                    offensive music to ever assault the ears of those who bear
                    witness to it.

                    Alternate Era is made up of C-Lock the Watchman and Ross A.M.
                    C-Lock the Watchman is the main MC and vocalist for Alternate
                    Era. He captures the raw nature of life within his lyrics,
                    vocal delivery and passion for music.
                    Ross A.M. is the lead singer and producer for Alternate Era.
                    Born from the darkest recesses of all that is strange about
                    the world, Ross A.M. channels the very vibes of the Eldritch
                    abyss into the beats, lyrics, and music that builds the foundation
                    of the Alternate Era universe.
