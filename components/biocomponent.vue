                    <strong>Alternate Era</strong> isn't just making music--
                    they're bending sound, warping time, and redefining what
                    hip-hop can be.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    This bi-coastal duo--<strong><u>Ross A.M.</u></strong>
                    (producer/multi-instrumentalist/singer) in
                    <strong>San Diego, CA</strong> and
                    <strong><u>C-Lock The Watchman</u></strong> in
                    <strong>Manhattan, NY</strong>--fuses hip-hop, electronic,
                    and experimental rock into a sound that's both futuristic
                    and nostalgic. Think
                    <strong> Gorillaz meets East Coast hip-hop</strong>, wrapped
                    in cinematic soundscapes and high-energy lyricism.

                    From hypnotic beats to razor-sharp bars,
                    <strong>Alternate Era</strong> doesn't play by the rules.
                    They create
                    <strong>immersive, genre-defying music</strong> that pulls
                    you in and doesn't let go. Whether in your headphones or on
                    stage, they deliver a sonic experience that
                    <strong>hits hard and stays with you.</strong>
