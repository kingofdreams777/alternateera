      <p>
        Alternate Era is an alternative hip-hop duo blending ethereal production, cinematic soundscapes, and high-energy
        lyricism. Inspired by Gorillaz, they fuse hip-hop, electronic, and experimental rock to create immersive,
        genre-defying music. With a bi-coastal creative process between San Diego (Ross –
        producer/multi-instrumentalist) and Manhattan (Chris – lyricist/rapper), their sound is both futuristic and
        nostalgic. Whether through hypnotic beats, introspective lyrics, or electrifying performances, Alternate Era
        delivers a sonic experience that pushes boundaries.
