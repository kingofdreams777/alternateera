            Alternate Era is an alternative hip-hop duo blending ethereal production, cinematic soundscapes,
            and high-energy lyricism. Inspired by <strong>Gorillaz</strong>, they fuse hip-hop, electronic, and
            experimental rock to create immersive, genre-defying music. With a bi-coastal creative process
            between <strong>San Diego (Ross – producer/multi-instrumentalist)</strong> and <strong>Manhattan (Chris –
                lyricist/rapper)</strong>,
            their sound is both futuristic and nostalgic. Whether through hypnotic beats, introspective lyrics,
            or electrifying performances, Alternate Era delivers a sonic experience that pushes boundaries.
